# Awards, Press, Blogs, and other Mentions of the dGC Project

## 2020 Health Tech Awards - **Best Health Tech Solution**

In the middle of the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic, we crafted the dGC project and went on to win the 202 Health Tech Award category for Best Health Tech Solution against a strong field of established health tech companies and NHS trusts. It was heartening to see infrastructural projects like ours being recognised as the building blocks of incredible future clinical interfaces.
