This is a modern dGC client for mobile, written in React Native by Dr Charles van Lennep. React Native is a cross platform native app development platform, and can therefore run on Android or iOS.

It uses the same [React Chart Component Library](../products/react-component.md) code for its charting.

We are hoping to be able to develop the React Native client into a useful RCPCH-approved multi-tool for clinicians, containing other calculations used every day in clinical practice, and backed by future APIs.
