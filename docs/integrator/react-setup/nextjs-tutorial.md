Next.js is a React framework commonly used by developers to create a React app in your IDE, taking the heavy lifting of doing so away from the developer. We will walk you through initialising and creating your first Next.js app.

!!! tip "Next.js"
    We highly recommend reading through the Next.js tutorial featured in the online documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs).

1. Run the following command:
    ```console
